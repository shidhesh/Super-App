# 🚀 **Super App: All-in-One Service Aggregator**

## 🌟 **Project Overview**

This repository contains the code and documentation for **Super App**, a unified platform where users can access multiple service categories like **Food Delivery**, **Travel**, and **Transport** within a single application. The app is designed for seamless navigation, providing users with a centralized hub for accessing popular services such as **Zomato, Swiggy, Uber, Ola,** and more.

## 💡 **Key Features**
- **Centralized Access:** One-stop solution for all your needs, from food delivery to transport and travel.
- **Interactive Categories:** Browse through categories like **Food, Travel,** and **Transport** with ease.
- **Smart Redirection:** Automatically opens the installed app or provides a webview fallback if the app isn’t installed.
- **Seamless Experience:** No need to clutter your phone with multiple apps—access everything in one place!
  
## 🖼️ **User Flow**
1. **Home Page:** Select a service category (e.g., Food, Travel).
2. **Category Page:** Choose from available platforms (e.g., Zomato, Swiggy).
3. **Platform Selection:** If the app is installed, it opens directly; if not, a webview loads the web version for you.
4. **Order or Service Page:** Complete your transaction without leaving the app interface.

## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**
- **Frontend:** React Native / Flutter (cross-platform support)
- **Backend:** Optional (Node.js / Django for analytics, user data)
- **Deep Linking:** Intent filters and URL schemes for opening installed apps
- **Webview Integration:** Embedded webview fallback for non-installed apps
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions, CircleCI, or Bitrise for smooth deployment
